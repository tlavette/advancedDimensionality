  Advanced dimensionality reduction uses methods beyond traditional approaches like PCA to uncover complex patterns in high-dimensional data. These techniques often involve non-linear transformations, probabilistic models, or data-driven learning to reduce dimensions while keeping important information. They are especially useful for capturing non-linear or intricate relationships in the data.
