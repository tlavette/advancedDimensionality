  Advanced dimensionality reduction uses methods beyond traditional approaches like PCA to uncover complex patterns in high-dimensional data. These techniques often involve non-linear transformations, probabilistic models, or data-driven learning to reduce dimensions while keeping important information. They are especially useful for capturing non-linear or intricate relationships in the data.
Examples include


t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
Kernel PCA <br>

Manifold Learning:

Isomap
Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
Hessian LLE
Probabilistic Methods:

Factor Analysis
Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVM)
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) <br>

Neural Network-Based Methods:

Autoencoders
Contrastive Learning (e.g., SimCLR)
Sparse and Structured Techniques:

Sparse PCA
Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
Scalable Algorithms for Large Data:

These techniques are designed to handle complex data structures, non-linear relationships, or large-scale datasets effectively.
